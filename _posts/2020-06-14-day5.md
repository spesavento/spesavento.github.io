This challenge asks you to print the first 10 integers of an integer n. 

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Input:**</span>

```python
2
```
<span style="color:blue">**Sample Output:**</span>

```python
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
```

For this challenge, you can use a for loop or a while loop, both of which are introduced below.

### for loops
A `for loop` loops over a certain number of iterations or through a list.

```python
#looping through a number of iterations
for i in range(5): #loops from 0 UP TO 5 --> 0 1 2 3 4
    print(i, end = '')
```
```python
01234  
```

```python
#looping through a list
iter_list = ['You', 'can', 'loop', 'through', 'me']
for i in iter_list:
    print(i, end = ' ')
```
```python
You can loop through me
```

It is common practice to use `i` and `j` to iterate through, but you can also use an underscore _ if you are not using the index anywhere.

```python
for _ in range(4):
    print('Hello')
```
```python
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
```
The loop will continue until it reaches the end of the range or a `break` statement. In the code below, once i == 5, it breaks out of the loop before it prints 5.
```python
for i in range(10): #loops from 0 UP TO 10 --> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```
```python
0
1
2
3
4
```

### while loops

A while loop continues until 


<span style="color:blue">**Sample Solution:**</span>
```python
class Person:
#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys



if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1,11): #from 1 UP to 11 (1-10)
        print(("{num} x {iter} = {mult}").format(num = n, iter = i, mult = n*i))
```
