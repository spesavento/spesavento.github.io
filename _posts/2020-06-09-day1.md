This challenges asks you to:
1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
3. Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
 <br>   <b>*</b> Print the sum of `i` plus your int variable on a new line.
  <br>  <b>*</b> Print the sum of `d` plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
  <br>  <b>*</b> Concatenate `s` with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recall from the last challenge that the `input()` function reads in a user input. However, the `input()` function only returns strings.
```python
int_input = input() #user enters a 4
dbl_input = input() #user enters a 4.5
str_input = input() #user enters Hello
```
```python
'4'
'4.5'
'Hello'
```
Notice that even when a number was entered, it is converted to a string. To avoid this, you can put convert the input into a integer/float type, use `int()` or `float()`. Keep in mind that if you use `int()` and the user enters a string like Hello, it will error out. This is why `input()` defaults to a string data type. A float, integer, or bool (True/False) can easily be converted to strings by putting quotes around them.
```python
int_input = int(input()) #user enters a 4
dbl_input = float(input()) #user enters a 4.5
str_input = input() #user enters Hello
```
```python
4
4.5
'Hello'
```

The `+` operator is used to sum numbers or concatenate (merge) strings. 
```python
print(3 + 4)
print(-1 + 5)
print(4 + 4.5)
a = 5
b = 6
print(a + b)
print('Hello' + 'Sara')
print('Hello ' + 'Sara')
print('Good' + ' ' + 'Morning')
```
```python
7
4
9.5  #int + float = float
11
'HelloSara'
'Hello Sara'
'Good Morning'
```

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Solution:**</span>
```python
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
new_int = int(input())
new_dbl = float(input())
new_str = input()

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i + new_int)

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(d + new_dbl)

# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
print(s + new_str)
```
