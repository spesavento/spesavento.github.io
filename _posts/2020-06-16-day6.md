Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line.

```python

Hacker
Rank
```

```python
Hce akr
Rn ak
```
One way to complete this problem is to loop through the indeces (length of the string), check if it's an even or an odd index, and concatenate it with the corresponding string. A sample solution is outlined below using this method.
```python
def even_odd(S):
    even_ind = "" #create a storage for even indeces
    odd_ind = "" #create a storage for odd indeces
    for i in range(len(S)): #from 0 up to length of the string
        if(i % 2 == 0): #check if an even index
            even_ind += S[i] #concatenate the character of the index with even_ind
        else: #else if an odd index
            odd_ind += S[i] #concatenate the character of the index with odd_ind
    print("{even} {odd}".format(even = even_ind, odd = odd_ind)) #print each, separated by a space

N = int(input()) #take in how many strings they will input
for i in range(N):
    user_str = input() #take string input from the user
    even_odd(user_str) #call the function for the string inputted
```
Instead of making a for loop to loop through the indeces one at a time, you can use the my_string[start:stop:by] indexing.

```python
#using string[start:stop], the "by" defaults to 1
s1 = "Hello"
s1[1:3]

#using string[start:stop:by]
s2 = "Hello World"
#print all even indeces from the beginning to end of the string 
#(len(s2) = 11 so index 10 "d" would be printed)
s2[0:len(s2):2] 

#when start is left blank it defaults to 0
#when end is left blank it defaults to the length of the string - 27
s3 = "Thanks for reading my blog!"
s3[::2]

#take odd indeces only
s3[1::2] #start from 1 through the end of the string
```
```python
el #from index 1 (e) UP TO index 3 (l)

HloWrd #from index 0 (H) through last index 10 (d)

Tak o edn ybo! #from index 0 (T) through last even index 26 (!)

hnsfrraigm lg #from index 1 "h" through the last odd index 25 (g)
```

With this concept, we could take a user string and print it's even and odd indeces.
```python
S = input() 
print(S[::2], S[1::2])
```

To allow the user to enter multiple strings, loop through a user input.
```python
def even_odd():
    for N in range(int(input())):
        S = input() 
        print(S[::2], S[1::2])

even_odd()
```

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Solution 1:**</span>
```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
def even_odd(s1):
    even_ind = ""
    odd_ind = ""
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if(i % 2 == 0):
            even_ind += s1[i]
        else:
            odd_ind += s1[i]
    print("{even} {odd}".format(even = even_ind, odd = odd_ind))

num_strs = int(input())
for i in range(num_strs):
    user_str = input()
    even_odd(user_str)
```

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Solution 2:**</span>
```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
def even_odd():
    for N in range(int(input())):
        S = input() 
        print(S[::2], S[1::2])

even_odd()
```
