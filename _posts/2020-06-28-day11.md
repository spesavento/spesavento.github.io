This challenge explores 2D arrays. Given a 6x6 2D array, there are 16 hourglass shapes within the array, as seen below. For example, in the following 6x6 array: 
```python
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0
```
We have the following 16 hourglass shapes
```python
1 1 1   1 1 0   1 0 0   0 0 0
  1       0       0       0
1 1 1   1 1 0   1 0 0   0 0 0

0 1 0   1 0 0   0 0 0   0 0 0
  1       1       0       0
0 0 2   0 2 4   2 4 4   4 4 0

1 1 1   1 1 0   1 0 0   0 0 0
  0       2       4       4
0 0 0   0 0 2   0 2 0   2 0 0

0 0 2   0 2 4   2 4 4   4 4 0
  0       0       2       0
0 0 1   0 1 2   1 2 4   2 4 0
```
If we sum up the numbers in each of these, the greatest sum would be 19.  <br>
2 4 4 <br>
&nbsp;2 <br>
1 2 4 <br>

To create a regular 1D array or list, you can create it directly or read in user inputs.
```python
my_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] #create the array yourself
print(my_arr)

user_1d_arr = list(map(int, input().strip().split())) #allow the user to input numbers all at once e.g. 3 2 4 1 2 
print(user_1d_arr)

user_2d_arr = [] #append each row to the end of the list
for _ in range(6):
    user_2d_arr.append(list(map(int, input().strip().split())))
print(user_2d_arr)
```
```python
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

[3, 2, 4, 1, 2]

[[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]
```

Before looping through the 2D array to find the maximum sum, we can create a `max_sum` variable. As it loops through the array, it will check each hourglass sum against this number. If the hourglass sum greater, the `max_sum` will be set to equal to this sum. At first, I used a default of 0. In the examples shown so far, 0 would work. However, the numbers within the hourglass can also be negative which is noted in the "Constraints" section of the problem. Instead, I set the `max_sum` variable equal to the sum of the first hourglass, however you could also set it equal to something like -100, which is outside the range. 

```python
arr = []
for _ in range(6):
    arr.append(list(map(int, input().rstrip().split())))
max_sum = arr[0][0] + arr[0][1] + arr[0][2] + arr[1][1] + arr[2][0] + arr[2][1] + arr[2][2] #the first hourglass
```

To loop through a 2D array, we need to keep track of both the rows and the columns. This can be done using a double loop (a for loop within another for loop). The following loop starts on row 0 (i=0) and then loops through columns 0-3. It ends on row 3 (i=3) and then loops through columns 0-3. Each element is accessed using array[row][column].

```python
#If the array 'arr' is as follows:
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0

for i in range(4):  #i is the row 
    for j in range(4): #j is the column
        print(arr[i][j]) #array[row][column] returns the element on this row/column

```
```python
1
1
1
0
0
1
0
0
1
1
1
0
0
0
2
4
```
You might notice that this didn't loop through every element of the 6x6 array. Instead, it's looping through the **top, left-most elements** of each of the 16 hourglasses. The rest can be summed up using indeces. 
```python
for i in range(4):
    for j in range(4):
        sum_curr = arr[i][j] + arr[i][j+1] + arr[i][j+2] + arr[i+1][j+1] + arr[i+2][j] + arr[i+2][j+1] + arr[i+2][j+2] #top row, middle row, end row  with arr[i][j] being the top, left-most part of the hourglass
        print(sum_curr)
```
```python
#the sums of each of 16 hourglasses 
7
4
2
0
4
8
10
8
3
6
7
6
3
9
19
14
```
**A shorter way to make this sum:**
```python
sum(arr[i][j:j+3]) + arr[i+1][j+1] + sum(arr[i+2][j:j+3])
```

Now all that is needed is a check to update the `max_sum`. In the 2D array we have been using, the `max_sum` would be set to 7 (the first hourglass sum), and then updated in the loop to 8, then 10, and then finally 19.
```python
for i in range(4):
    for j in range(4):
        sum_curr = arr[i][j] + arr[i][j+1] + arr[i][j+2] + arr[i+1][j+1] + arr[i+2][j] + arr[i+2][j+1] + arr[i+2][j+2] #top row, middle row, end row  with arr[i][j] being the top, left-most part of the hourglass
        if sum_curr > max_sum:  #if the current sum is greater than the max_sum (originally set to the first hourglass sum)
            max_sum = sum_curr
```
