In this challenge you are given an integer, `n`, and asked to perform the following conditional actions:
* If `N` is odd, print Weird
* If `N` is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
* If `N` is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
* If `N` is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Constraints: 1 <= N <= 100

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Input:**</span>
```c
3
```
<span style="color:blue">**Sample Output:**</span>

```python
Weird
```

One solution would be to simply go through the bullet points and make an if statement for each or an if/elif/else statement. Although it's not the most efficient solution, it will run correctly.
```python
N = int(input())

#If N is odd, print Weird
if N % 2 != 0: #if n is odd
    print('Weird')
#If N is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
elif N % 2 == 0 and N >= 2 and N <= 5:
    print('Not Weird')
#If N is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
elif N % 2 == 0 and N >= 6 and N <= 20:
    print('Weird')
else:
    print('Not Weird')
```

This can be shortened quite a bit. 'Weird' is printed when n is odd and when it's even between 6 and 20. In all other cases, it will print 'Not Weird'

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Solution:**</span>
```python
N = int(input())

#If n is odd or between 6 and 20
if N % 2 != 0 or (N >=6 and N <= 20):
    print('Weird')
else:
    print('Not Weird')
```

The print function can also condense if/else statements into one line. But the goal is clear and readable code, not necessarily the shortest possible program. 
```python
N = int(input())

print('Weird' if (N % 2 != 0 or (6 <= N <= 20)) else 'Not  Weird')
```
