In this challenge, you are given two classes, Person and Student. Person is the base class (superclass) and Student is the derived class (subclass). A derived class means that Student inherits all the methods and behaviors from the Person class. It can also declare it's own new methods (as well as override superclass methods). In this case, the Person superclass might take a name and an age. Every person created has a name and an age. The Student class inherits these from the Person class because each Student also has a name and an age! However, the Student has it's own new method that calculates a person's grade as well.

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Input:**</span>

```python
Heraldo Memelli 8135627
2
100 80
```
<span style="color:blue">**Sample Output:**</span>

```python
Name: Memelli, Heraldo
ID: 8135627
Grade: O
```

Below is the Person class given to us. Each Person created has a first name, a last name, and an ID number.
```python
class Person: #superclass
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber):
		self.firstName = firstName
		self.lastName = lastName
		self.idNumber = idNumber
	def printPerson(self):
		print("Name:", self.lastName + ",", self.firstName)
		print("ID:", self.idNumber)
 
line = input().split() #Sara Pesavento 3301872
firstName = line[0] #Sara
lastName = line[1] #Pesavento
idNum = line[2] #3301872
scores = list( map(int, input().split()) ) #90 100 80 85
s = Student(firstName, lastName, idNum, scores)  #we will create this Student subclass later 
s.printPerson() #a method in the Person class
print("Grade:", s.calculate()) #a method in the Student subclass
```

When we create our Student subclass, we will have it inherit all the methods and parameters of the Person superclass by defining it with *class Student(Person):*
```python
class Person: #superclass
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber):
		self.firstName = firstName
		self.lastName = lastName
		self.idNumber = idNumber
	def printPerson(self):
		print("Name:", self.lastName + ",", self.firstName)
		print("ID:", self.idNumber)
 
class Student(Person): 
    pass

line = input().split() #Sara Pesavento 3301872
firstName = line[0] #Sara
lastName = line[1] #Pesavento
idNum = line[2] #3301872
scores = list( map(int, input().split()) ) #90 100 80 85
s = Student(firstName, lastName, idNum, scores)  #we will create this Student subclass later 
s.printPerson() #a method in the Person class
print("Grade:", s.calculate()) #a method in the Student subclass
```

Now, when we create our Student class constructor, we must include all the parameters inherited from the Person class (firstName, lastName, idNumber), plus our own that are unique to the Student subclass (scores).

```python
class Person: #superclass
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber):
		self.firstName = firstName
		self.lastName = lastName
		self.idNumber = idNumber
	def printPerson(self):
		print("Name:", self.lastName + ",", self.firstName)
		print("ID:", self.idNumber)
 
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber, scores):
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName
        self.idNumber = idNumber
        self.scores = scores

line = input().split() #Sara Pesavento 3301872
firstName = line[0] #Sara
lastName = line[1] #Pesavento
idNum = line[2] #3301872
scores = list( map(int, input().split()) ) #90 100 80 85
s = Student(firstName, lastName, idNum, scores)  #we will create this Student subclass later 
s.printPerson() #a method in the Person class
print("Grade:", s.calculate()) #a method in the Student subclass
```

Within our student subclass, we can create a unique method `calculate` that calculates a student's grade based on their average score.

```python
class Person: #superclass
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber):
		self.firstName = firstName
		self.lastName = lastName
		self.idNumber = idNumber
	def printPerson(self):
		print("Name:", self.lastName + ",", self.firstName)
		print("ID:", self.idNumber)
 
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber, scores):
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName
        self.idNumber = idNumber
        self.scores = scores

    def calculate(self):
        average = sum(self.scores)/len(self.scores)
        if average <= 100 and average >= 90:
            return "O"
        elif average >= 80 and average < 90:
            return "E"
        elif average >= 70 and average < 80:
            return "A"
        elif average >= 55 and average < 70:
            return "P"
        elif average >= 40 and average < 55:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "T"

line = input().split() #Sara Pesavento 3301872
firstName = line[0] #Sara
lastName = line[1] #Pesavento
idNum = line[2] #3301872
scores = list( map(int, input().split()) ) #90 100 80 85
s = Student(firstName, lastName, idNum, scores)  #we will create this Student subclass later 
s.printPerson() #a method in the Person class
print("Grade:", s.calculate()) #a method in the Student subclass
```

Notice at the bottom that an instance object `s` is created from the Student class. The printPerson() method from the Person class is called. Since the Student class inherits all the methods from the Person class, this can be done. Next, the calculate() method from the Student class is called.

    #   Class Constructor
    #   
    #   Parameters:
    #   firstName - A string denoting the Person's first name.
    #   lastName - A string denoting the Person's last name.
    #   id - An integer denoting the Person's ID number.
    #   scores - An array of integers denoting the Person's test scores.
    #
    # Write your constructor here
    def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber, scores):
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName

        self.scores = scores
    #   Function Name: calculate
    #   Return: A character denoting the grade.

    # Write your function here
    def calculate(self):
        average = sum(self.scores)/len(self.scores)
        if average <= 100 and average >= 90:
            return "O"
        elif average >= 80 and average < 90:
            return "E"
        elif average >= 70 and average < 80:
            return "A"
        elif average >= 55 and average < 70:
            return "P"
        elif average >= 40 and average < 55:

        else:
            return "T"
```
