In this challenge, you must create a phone book with names as the keys and phone numbers as the values. The dictionary will first be filled with `n` key-value pairs like sam 99912222 or tom 11122222. Then the user will search for names like 'sam' and it should return back sam=99912222. If a name is entered that is not a key in the dictionary, print 'Not found'.

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Input:**</span>

```python
3
sam 99912222
tom 11122222
harry 12299933
sam
edward
harry
```
<span style="color:blue">**Sample Output:**</span>

```python
sam=99912222
Not found
harry=12299933
```

While an empty list can be created using brackets [], empty dictionary can be created using curly brackets {}. In the code below I read in how many entries/key-value pairs will be added to my dictionary as `n`. I then create the empty dictionary and call it `phone_dict`

```python
n = int(input()) #number of key-value pairs
phone_dict = {}  #creating an empty dictionary
```

In order to populate a dictionary (e.g. aDict = {}), you will add the key-value pair using the format: aDict[key] = value. In this case, I'd want to add an entry to my phone_dict as phone_dict[name] = phoneNumber.

I'll loop over the number of key-value pairs that will be entered. In each loop, I read in a key-value pair, and add it to my dictionary.

```python
n = int(input()) #number of key-value pairs
phone_dict = {}  #creating an empty dictionary

for i in range(n):
    user_input = input().split() #name and number e.g. ['sara', '555-5555']
    phone_dict[user_input[0]] = user_input[1] #aDict[key] = value --> phone_dict[name] = phoneNumber
```
If you print the dictionary now, it will return:





n = int(input()) #number of key-value pairs
phone_dict = {}
for i in range(n):
    user_input = input().split() #name and number e.g. ['sara', '555-5555']
    phone_dict[user_input[0]] = user_input[1] #aDict = {} aDict[key] = value
while True:
    try:
        name = input() #input a key to find
        if phone_dict.get(name, 'Not found') == 'Not found':
            print('Not found')
        else:
            print("{0}={1}".format(name, phone_dict[name]))
    except:
        break



The first thing to do is the read an array of numbers from the user. 
```python
arr = list(map(int, input().strip().split())) 
```
In the code above:
* **input()** take a user input with as many numbers as they want in the array. 
* input()**.strip()** removes any blank spaces so 3   4   2 1   is made to be "3421"
* input().strip()**.split()** splits "3421" into "3" "4" "2" "1". 
* map(int, __) in **list(map(int,** input().strip().split()**))** converts the strings into integers, but alone it returns a map object. It needs list() to convert it into an array of [3, 4, 2, 1].


The next step is to reverse the elements in the array. One way to go about this would be to use for loop. The range that a for loop loops over is **range(start, stop, step)**. To loop backwards, you could start at the end, stop at the beginning and make the step -1 (decreasing). However, you must be careful with looping and indecing, as the index might be out of bounds. 

In the example below, there is an array of 4 elements. The for loop loops from 0 **up to** the length of the array (4), by an increment of 1. This is perfect for indecing, as rev_num[0] = 1, rev_num[1] = 4, rev_num[2] = 3 and rev_num[3] = 2.
```python
rev_num = [1, 4, 3, 2]
for i in range(len(rev_num)): #range(start, stop, step) from start UP TO stop
    print(i, end = ' ')
```
```python
0 1 2 3
```
But what if you switched it to loop backwards? This loops FROM the length of the array (4) **down to** 0, by an increment of -1. Now if you use indecing, rev_num[4] is out of bounds, giving an error, and rev_num[3], rev_num[2], and rev_num[1] would only print 1 4 3. 
```python
rev_num = [1, 4, 3, 2]
for i in range(len(rev_num),0,-1): #range(start, stop, step) from start UP TO stop
    print(i, end = ' ')
```
```python
4 3 2 1
```
Therefore, you actually want to use i-1
```python
rev_num = [1, 4, 3, 2]
for i in range(len(rev_num),0,-1): #range(start, stop, step) from start UP TO stop
    print(i-1, end = ' ')
```
```python
3 2 1 0
```

An easier way to accomplish this is to utilize the my_string[start:stop:by] notation from the last challenge.  When start is left blank it defaults to 0, and when end is left blank it defaults to the length of the string/array. You do not have to worry about indecing here. In order to extract these numbers from the list, use the `*` before the array.
```python
"hello"[::-1] 

rev_num = [1, 4, 3, 2]
rev_num[::-1]
*rev_num[::-1]
```
```python
olleh

[2, 3, 4, 1]
2 3 4 1
```

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Solution 1:**</span>

```python
#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input()) #number of integers in the array
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split())) #the array

    for i in range(n,0,-1):
        print(arr[i-1], end = " ")
```

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Solution 2:**</span>

```python
#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input()) #not needed for this code
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split())) #the array

    print(*arr[::-1])
```
