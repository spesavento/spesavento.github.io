This challenge asks you to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion. 

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Input:**</span>

```python
3 #factorial
```
<span style="color:blue">**Sample Output:**</span>

```python
6 #3*2*1
```

Recursion is when a function calls itself one or more times in order to solve a problem. 

Imagine a factorial problem: 5! 
n! can be rewritten as n*(n-1)!

5! = 5*4!
4! = 4*3!
3! = 3*2! 
2! = 2*1! 
1! = 1*0! 
At this point, when n = 1, it just becomes 1 and doesn't call the function again. Otherwise you'd keep going like below: <br>
0! = 0*-1!
-1 = -1*-2! 
...

So, as long as n > 1, we want to keep calling n*(n-1)! until n becomes 1. 

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n > 1:
        return n * factorial(n-1) #recursive case
    else:
        return 1 #base case

factorial(3)
```
Below is a walkthrough of the logic:
The factorial function is first called with n = 3. 3 is greater than 1 so it returns 3*factorial(2). <br>
We now have: **3 x factorial(2)** <br>
When factorial(2) is called, n = 2 and 2 is greater than 1 so it returns 2*factorial(1). <br>
We now have: **3 x 2 x factorial(1)** <br>
When factorial(1) is called, n = 1 and 1 is not greater than 1, so 1 is returned. <br>
We now have: **3 x 2 x 1** = 6. <br>
In the function above, the function continues to call itself until it reaches the `base case` of 1, where recursion is no longer called.

Another problem that could use recursion is the Fibonacci sequence. In this sequence, any number from value 2 (index 3) on is equal to Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. E.g. 1 1 2 3 5 8... Below is a recursive function fib that finds the fibonacci number Fn given the index n.

```python
def fib(n): 
    if n >= 3:
        return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)  #recursive case
    else:
        return 1 #base case
fib(6) #should return value at index 6, which is 8.
```
Below is a walkthrough of the logic:
The fibonacci function is first called with index n = 6. 6 is greater than or equal to 3 so it returns fib(4) + fib(5). <br>
We now have: **fib(4) + fib(5)** <br>
When fib(4) is called, n = 4 and 4 is greater than or equal to 3 so it returns fib(2) + fib(3). When fib(5) is called, n = 5 and 5 is greater than or equal to 3 so it returns fib(3) + fib(4). <br>
We now have: **fib(2) + fib(3) + fib(3) + fib(4)** 
When fib(2) is called, n = 2 and 2 is not greater than or equal to 3 so it returns 1. When fib(3) is called, n = 3 and 3 is greater than or equal to 3 so it returns fib(1) + fib(2). When fib(4) is called, n = 4 and 4 is greater than or equal to 3 so it returns fib(2) + fib(3)
We now have: **1 + fib(1) + fib(2) + fib(1) + fib(2) + fib(2) + fib(3)** 
In fib(1) and fib(2), n <= 3 so they return 1. fib(3) again returns fib(1) + fib(2). 
We now have: **1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + fib(1) + fib(2)** 
Again, in fib(1) and fib(2), n <= 3 so they return 1.
We now have: **1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8**

<span style="color:blue">**Sample Solution:**</span>

```python
#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

# Complete the factorial function below.
def factorial(n):
    if n > 1:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
    else:
        return 1


if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    n = int(input()) #assume n is between 2 and 12

    result = factorial(n)

    fptr.write(str(result) + '\n')

    fptr.close()
```
